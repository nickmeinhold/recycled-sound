# Recycled Sound

## What This Is
Recycled Sound is a community app that collects, services, and redistributes donated hearing aids to people who can't afford them — primarily refugees, asylum seekers, and low-income residents in Greater Dandenong, Victoria.

The hero feature is a **Google Lens-style scanner** that identifies hearing aid brand, model, specs, and capabilities from a photo. The scanner is a **human-in-the-loop tool** — it pre-fills what it can, then the audiologist confirms/corrects.

## Partners
- **Rotary Club of Springvale City** — applicant org, volunteers, governance
- **Arches Audiology** (Seray Lim, Clinical Audiologist) — clinical partner, QA, device fitting
- **University of Melbourne & La Trobe** — audiology student volunteers

## Key Decision: Human in the Loop
**All recipient-facing workflows must be human-mediated.** No automation touches recipients (asylum seekers, refugees) directly until manual workflows are tested and proven safe. This is a firm project decision from Sprint 6 (Feb 2026).

## App User Types
- **Donor** — donates hearing aids, optionally connects with recipient
- **Recipient** — applies for a device, uploads hearing assessment
- **Audiologist** — reviews AI-identified specs, confirms tech level, marks QA passed
- **Admin** — manages matching, approves workflows, moderates messaging
- **Psychologist** — directory listing (Sprint 3)
- **Overseas Partner Organisation** — Phase 2

## Device Register
~20 devices already collected. The register tracks 26 fields per device:
- Brand, model, type, year, serial numbers
- Battery size, dome type, wax filter, receiver
- Programming interface (HiPro, Noahlink, Noahlink Wireless)
- Tech level, gain range, fitting range
- Remote fine-tuning capability, app compatibility, Auracast readiness
- Charger details, accessories, QA status, servicing costs

Brands on register: Unitron, Phonak, Oticon, Signia, GN Resound, Beltone, Widex, Blamey & Saunders.

## Scanner Pipeline

### Architecture
Hybrid **CLIP visual search** + **Google Vision API** (OCR + labels) → **on-device fusion engine**.

Two Cloud Functions fire in parallel:
- `clip_encode` (Python, ViT-B-32 laion2b) → 512-dim embedding → cosine similarity against 1,927 pre-computed embeddings
- `analyzeHearingAid` (TypeScript) → Vision API label + text detection → catalog matching

Results fused on-device by `scan_fusion.dart` using a confidence matrix.

### E2E Test Results (2026-03-22)
Tested with 12 real photos from Seray's device register. Key findings:
- **OCR is the strongest signal** — correctly ID'd Oticon Nera2 Pro and Unitron Moxi S-R from device body text
- **CLIP visual search has a domain gap** — avg similarity 0.518 (all LOW). Product shots ≠ real-world hand-held photos
- **Fuzzy matching essential** — OCR reads "oricon" not "oticon", "movi" not "moxi". Levenshtein ≤ 1 catches these

### Audiologist's 7-Field Model (from Seray)
What the scanner should capture per device:
1. **Make** — AI via OCR ✓
2. **Model** — AI via OCR ✓
3. **Style** (BTE/RIC/ITE/CIC) — needs human input
4. **Tubing** (slim/standard/none) — needs human input (NEW field, not yet in schema)
5. **Battery or Rechargeable** — needs human confirmation
6. **Battery size** (10/13/312/675) — potential AI task (battery door shapes are visually distinct)
7. **Colour** — present swatches for human to confirm

### Test Harness
`data/test_pipeline.py` — runs photos through both CLIP and Vision API locally, compares results. Usage:
```
python3 data/test_pipeline.py /path/to/photo.jpg        # single photo
python3 data/test_pipeline.py /path/to/folder/           # batch mode
python3 data/test_pipeline.py /path/to/folder/ --json    # machine-readable
```
Requires: `google-cloud-vision`, `open_clip`, `torch`, `chromadb`. Uses ADC credentials — set `quota_project_id` to `recycled-sound-app`.

### Current Scanner Architecture (as of 2026-04-25)
On-device pipeline: Camera → FramePreprocessor (auto-cycling RAW/ENHANCE/HI-CON/OCR) → ML Kit OCR + ColourClassifier → BrandMatcher → DeviceIndex elimination tree → 7-field HUD with slot reel animations → catalog cascade auto-fill.

Neural net (EfficientNet-B0 TFLite) fires on auto-capture stills. Dual-signal fusion (OCR + neural net). Colour detection is OCR-gated. 3D Object Capture via ARKit (guided flow built, untested).

## Current Plan (as of 2026-04-25)

### THE CRUX: 15-Second Detection Latency
The scanner takes 15+ seconds to detect a hearing aid brand. This is the #1 issue — it affects demo reliability (external talks booked) and clinical usability. Root causes identified:

1. **Edge detection (Sobel) was eating frame budget** — disabled, but verify no remnant code paths
2. **Periodic captures pause camera stream every 3s** — steals OCR frames during active detection

**Governing principle:** Visual polish is NOT free on a single-threaded camera pipeline. Every feature in `_processFrame` competes with OCR for frames. See `feedback_detection_throughput_sacred.md`.

### Priority Order

**P0. Fix Detection Speed** (do this first)
- [ ] Profile `_processFrame` in `live_scanner_screen.dart` — measure actual ms/frame
- [ ] Verify edge detection is fully disabled (no remnant code paths running)
- [ ] Fix periodic captures — must NOT fire during active detection (only after brand+model locked)
- [ ] Target: brand detection < 5 seconds on known devices
- Key files: `live_scanner_screen.dart`, `edge_detector.dart`

**P1. Better Visualizations & Feedback**
- [ ] Meaningful feedback that communicates detection state (not decorative animation)
- [ ] Bounding boxes are the hero moment — keep and polish (see `feedback_demo_legibility.md`)
- [ ] Expand status text showing filter + text regions
- Avoid: adding anything to the frame processing loop without measuring impact

**P2. Shape, Tubing, Battery Door Detection**
- [ ] Style (BTE/RIC/ITE/CIC) — CLIP probe showed 91.2% accuracy, ready to integrate
- [ ] Tubing (slim/standard/none) — human-only for now, add field to device schema
- [ ] Battery door classifier (4 classes: 10/13/312/675) — visual classifier needed

**P3. Demo Reliability & Deployment**
- [ ] Verify camera→ARKit handoff fix on device (committed but untested)
- [ ] Deploy TestFlight — 19+ days of undeployed code since build 7 (v0.3.2, 2026-04-06)
- [ ] DeviceIndex backtracking — wrong early narrowing cascades into wrong ID (see `feedback_elimination_tree_backtracking.md`)

**P4. 3D Point Cloud** (deprioritized behind speed fix)
- [ ] ObjectCaptureView guided flow needs on-device testing
- See `technical_3d_point_cloud.md`

### What NOT to Do
- Don't add visual features to the frame processing loop without measuring ms/frame impact
- Don't narrow DeviceIndex on < 70% neural net confidence
- Don't remove OCR patterns without testing against all known devices (short patterns like 'opn', 'ria', 'ino' are real model names)
- Don't use `context.push()` when navigating away from camera — use `context.go()` (camera never disposes otherwise)

### Key Files for Scanner Work
- `lib/features/scanner/presentation/live_scanner_screen.dart` — main scanner, frame processing, state machine
- `lib/features/scanner/data/device_index.dart` — elimination tree (~380 lines)
- `lib/features/scanner/data/brand_matcher.dart` — OCR pattern matching
- `lib/features/scanner/data/edge_detector.dart` — Sobel edge detection (DISABLED)
- `lib/features/scanner/presentation/widgets/slot_reel_text.dart` — slam animation
- `lib/features/scanner/presentation/widgets/scan_hud.dart` — 7-field HUD
- `lib/features/scanner/presentation/widgets/feature_overlay_painter.dart` — bounding box overlay

### Context
- Grant outcome June 2026 shapes resourcing; working app strengthens 2027 large grant bid
- TestFlight v0.3.2 (build 7) was last deployed 2026-04-06. Massive feature gap since: 7-field HUD, catalog cascade, slot reels, DeviceIndex, edge detection, 3D capture — ALL undeployed
- Rotary talk got standing ovation (2026-04-22). Bounding boxes had most audience impact. Multiple clubs requested talks
- Video analysis workflow (screen record → ffmpeg → Claude analysis) is a proven diagnostic tool
